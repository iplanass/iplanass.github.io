Summary
======
I am a behavioural ecologist working at the interface of theoretical ecology and complex systems science. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the RIKEN Center for Interdisciplinary Theoretical and Mathematical Sciences (iTHEMS, Japan) and a part-time lecturer at the University of Tokyo. My research combines tools from multiple disciplines to uncover the drivers of collective phenomena and to identify the mechanisms that sustain diversity at group and ecosystem levels. Along the way, research has taken me through Spain, Ecuador, Perú, France, Belgium, the USA, England, and Japan.
