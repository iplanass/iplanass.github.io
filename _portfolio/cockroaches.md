Collective behaviour has fascinated mankind since the beginning of the modern age⁠. It is not surprising to observe children admiring long trails of ants, or find ourselves wondering how shoals of fish or flocks of birds coordinate their movements in perfect synchrony. The mechanisms, rules and interactions behind these phenomena is at the heart of the collective behaviour research. Group-living can entail many challenges, such as the coordination of movements or making decisions. These collective decisions can be further complicated when individuals differ in their experience, age, motivation, leadership or preference. For instance, individuals can differ from one another on their tendency to take risks or perform actions. When these differences between individuals are consistent over time and contexts we can refer to them as animal personality variation, polyethism, behavioural syndromes or behavioural diversity. My research aims to investigate the proximate and ultimate mechanisms underlying animal personality variation, and determine its relative contribution to the success of collective tasks under different social and environmental contexts.

To facilitate the study of animal behaviour in the lab, I also develop tools to automate image analysis. In this case, the tracking software processes the image (black/white) to automatically identify the males via the QR codes, and we use the output to analyse aggressive interactions, so we can then investigate dominance hierarchy formation in the Madagascar hissing cockroach.
